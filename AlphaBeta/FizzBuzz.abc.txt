# Code explanation, bit by bit:
x               # Initialize R1 to 0
a               # Increment R1
yY              # Reset R2 and memory pointer
ggg             # Set R2 to 3
vI              # Store R1 % R2 in memory
S               # Increment memory pointer
gg              # Set R2 to 5
vI              # Store R1 % R2 in memory
TH              # Load R1 % 3 into R2
n               # Set R3 to !R2
ZYUUUUUUTTTTZR  # Jump to the next check if R3 is 0 (if R1 is not divisible by 3)
ykjjjDL         # Print "F"
ykgggggDL       # Print "i"
hhhiiDLL        # Print "zz"
SH              # Load R1 % 5 into R2

ZUUUUUTTTTTTZR  # Jump to the next check if R3 is 0 (if R1 is not divisible by 5)
ykjjjhhhhDL     # Print "B"
iiiiigDL        # Print "u"
gggggDLL        # Print "zz"
ZYWUUUTTTTTTTZ  # Set position pointer to "Print newline"
HDR             # Jump to "Print newline" if R1 is divisible by 5
THDR            # Jump to "Print newline" if R1 is divisible by 3
CM              # Print R1
